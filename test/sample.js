module.exports = `In this lesson students explore and predict how they can use loops to more efficiently write code. They will begin to transfer their coding concepts from a paper world to the unplugged platform and in the end will have code they are ready to test online in the next lesson.

[Maze handout][maze-handout]


- I can use the debugging process to debug my code.
- I can replace a repeating sequence with a loop to increase code efficiency and readability.

###### Teacher Materials:
- [ ] Projector
- [ ] Unplugged Foam Maze 
- [ ] Whiteboard 
- [ ] Teacher Scratch Blocks magnetic


###### Student Materials: 
- [ ] [Maze Handout][maze-handout] (class set) - Editable version here
- [ ] Scratch block strips (1 set per group)
- [ ] Felt (1 per group)
- [ ] Role Cards (1 set per group)
- [ ] Dry erase markers (class set)
- [ ] Rovers (class set)

<div>
- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **For-Loop:** A type of loop that specifies the number of times to repeat the nested sequence of instructions.
</div>

### Do Now (10 min)

- [ ] Explain the new format of our lessons: 
	- The class will be in 2 groups assigned by the teacher. 
	- While one group completes a coding lesson with the teacher, the other group practices a coding concept independently.
	- Halfway through class the groups will switch so that everyone completes both sets of activities.
- [ ] Demonstrate the independent work
	- Show students code.org using the tinyurl for the assigned lesson.
	- Review expectations for using the computers independently. It is important students work silently and troubleshoot independently so that the group in the front of the room can hear the lesson.
- [ ] Move students into groups

### Small Group Lesson (17 min)

#### Engage: Sequence Through a Maze (5 min)
- [ ] **Practice Sequence Debugging:** Instruct students to move their rover around their paper maze to **identify where in the given sequence there is a bug**. Students can use a dry erase marker to tick off each line of code as it is completed. 
- [ ] **Students Propose Solutions:**


###### key points
- [ ] **Perform Solution:** Assign students to group roles to act out the code. 

#### Introducing Loops (7 min)
- [ ] **Assign Group Roles:** Students are working in groups of 4 for this lesson and should pull group roles. Review each role’s responsibilities. 

- [ ] **Discover Loops:** Working in groups
	- **Plan:** Students use dry erase marker to draw the path the rover will take around their maze.
	- **Code:** Students put together a sequence of code on their felt to circumnavigate the grid.  Do not give them enough move and turn blocks. Each group will only have 2 of each type of block. 
	- **Validate:** Run your code from the beginning to test it.

- [ ] **Add Loop Blocks:** Wait until students identify that there are not enough blocks before introducing loops.  Without introducing them verbally, place loop strips on each group’s table:

- [ ] **Demo Code:** Call on one group to demo their code by bringing their felt up to the board and acting it out on the unplugged maze.

- [ ] **Predict Vocabulary Definitions:** Each group’s driver holds up each loop as you introduce it.

###### key points

#### Loops in the Real World (5 min)
- [ ] **Teach the Loop Gesture:** Have students move their hand in the loop gesture to remember to read each nested line of code and then return to the start of the loop. 
- [ ] **Examples of loops in real life:** Have students identify the type of loop you would use for each of the examples below.
- [ ] **Think Pair Share:** What other examples of loops can you come up with?
